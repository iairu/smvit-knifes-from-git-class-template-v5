## 🗂️ 1️⃣ Issues (Tasks, Submissions, Reports)

✅ **What are Issues?**  
Tasks or reports created in the repository.

✅ **How to use?**
- Click **New Issue** → select prepared template.
- Fill in required fields (title, links, notes).
- Submit.

✅ **Tip for students:**  
Always use Issues via templates to stay on track.

---

## 🏁 2️⃣ Milestones (Goals, Deadlines, Phases)

✅ **What are Milestones?**  
Collections of Issues/PRs grouped under one goal or deadline.

✅ **How to use?**
- Teacher creates milestone, e.g., `Assignment 1`, `Demo v1.0`.
- Link related Issues to this milestone.
- Track progress with a progress bar.

✅ **Tip for teachers:**  
Use milestones only for major goals, not every little task.

---

## 🔖 3️⃣ Labels (Tags, Categories)

✅ **What are Labels?**  
Color-coded tags to classify Issues.

✅ **Examples:**
- `type: submission` → student work
- `type: bug` → error report
- `role: student` → created by student
- `role: teacher` → teacher action

✅ **Tip:**  
Start with a few essential labels.

---

## 📋 4️⃣ Projects (Kanban, Visual Management)

✅ **What are Projects?**  
Kanban board or table to visualize Issues.

✅ **How to use?**
- Create a project with columns like: To Do / In Progress / Done.
- Add Issues manually or use filters.
- Monitor team or project progress visually.

✅ **Tip:**  
Start with Issues + Milestones. Use Projects when the number of tasks grows.
