<p>USB devices are ubiquitous tools in modern technology, but not all of them are harmless. Among the most concerning developments is the “USB Killer”—a device specifically designed to damage or destroy hardware through a high-voltage electrical surge. This guide explores the mechanics of USB Killers, the risks they pose, and practical steps to safeguard your devices and sensitive data from these malicious tools.
What Is a USB Killer?</p>
<p>A USB Killer is a seemingly harmless device that resembles a standard USB drive. However, its purpose is anything but benign. When connected to a USB port, it delivers a high-voltage surge back into the system, often resulting in irreparable damage to the device. Originally developed as a proof-of-concept for identifying vulnerabilities, USB Killers are now being misused as malicious tools.
How Does It Work?</p>
<p>Energy Harvesting: The device extracts power from the USB port and stores it in internal capacitors.
Voltage Surge: It rapidly discharges the stored energy, creating a voltage surge that overwhelms the system.
Hardware Damage: Key components like the motherboard, USB controllers, and other connected peripherals can be permanently damaged.</p>
<p>Understanding the Risks</p>
<p>The potential damage caused by USB Killers goes beyond physical hardware destruction. These tools can lead to:</p>
<p>Data Loss: Essential files and information may become irretrievable.
Operational Downtime: Damaged systems can disrupt workflows in businesses or personal use.
Financial Costs: Repairs or replacements for affected devices can be costly.</p>
<p>How to Protect Your Devices from USB Killers</p>
<p>Avoid Untrusted USB Devices
Only use USB devices from reputable sources.
Be cautious of promotional USB drives or devices with unknown origins.
Implement Physical Security Measures
Use port blockers or locks to restrict access to USB ports on your devices.
Store critical devices in secure locations to prevent unauthorized access.
Disable Unused Ports
Disable unused USB ports in your system’s BIOS or through administrative controls.
Limit USB access to only essential devices.
Invest in USB Protection Devices
Specialized USB protection tools, such as data-only cables, can prevent electrical surges.
Endpoint security software can monitor USB activities and block suspicious devices.</p>
<p>Broader Implications for Data Integrity</p>
<p>While USB Killers represent a clear threat to physical devices, they also highlight the importance of protecting data and content from less visible risks. Just as malicious hardware can compromise systems, unverified or plagiarized content can undermine credibility in digital spaces.</p>
<p>For example, ensuring the originality of your content is crucial in academic, professional, and creative contexts. Tools like Paper-Checker.com provide advanced solutions for detecting plagiarism and AI-generated content. By integrating such tools into your workflow, you can maintain the integrity of your work and protect intellectual property.
Conclusion</p>
<p>USB Killers serve as a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities inherent in modern technology. By understanding how these devices operate and adopting preventive measures, you can safeguard your hardware and data. Similarly, taking steps to protect the integrity of your digital content ensures credibility and trustworthiness.</p>
<p>Whether securing your devices from malicious tools or ensuring originality in your content, proactive measures are key to staying safe in a rapidly evolving technological landscape.</p>

<p>An Indian national in the US has pleaded guilty this week to destroying 59 computers at the College of St. Rose, in New York, using a weaponized USB thumb drive named &quot;USB Killer&quot; that he purchased online.

Yes, you need a firewall on Linux - here&#x27;s why and which to use</p>
<p>The incident took place on February 14, according to court documents obtained by ZDNet, and the suspect, Vishwanath Akuthota, 27, filmed himself while destroying some of the computers.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m going to kill this guy,&quot; &quot;it&#x27;s dead,&quot; and &quot;it&#x27;s gone. Boom,&quot; Akuthota said on recordings obtained by the prosecution.</p>
<p>The suspect destroyed 59 computers, but also seven computer monitors and computer-enhanced podiums that had open USB slots.</p>
<p>He did it using USB Killer, a weaponized thumb drive that he purchased from a well-known online store that sells these types of devices.</p>
<p>USB Killer devices work by rapidly charging thumb drive capacitors from the USB power supply, and then discharging the electrical current back into the USB slot --all in a matter of seconds-- effectively frying the computer to which the USB Killer device is connected.</p>
<p>Equipment damages amounted to $51,109, along with $7,362 in employee time for investigating and replacing destroyed hardware, which Akuthota agreed to pay as part of the plea deal, according to court documents.</p>
<p>He graduated College of St. Rose in 2017 with an MBA, and on the night of the incident, he was no longer a student at the college and was residing in the US on a student visa.</p>
<p>Akuthota was arrested on February 22 and will be sentenced later this year, on August 12. He faces up to ten years in prison, a fine of up to $250,000, and a term of post-imprisonment supervised release of up to 3 years.</p>

<p>Last year we wrote about the “USB Killer”—a DIY USB stick that fried almost everything (laptops, smartphones, consoles, cars) that it was plugged into. Now the USB Killer has been mass produced—you can buy it online for about £50/$50. Now everyone can destroy just about every computer that has a USB port. Hooray.</p>
<p>The commercialised USB Killer looks like a fairly humdrum memory stick. You can even purchase a “Test Shield” for £15/$15, which lets you try out the kill stick—watch the spark of electricity arc between the two wires!—without actually frying the target device, though I’m not sure why you would want to spend £65 to do that. The website proudly states that the USB Killer is CE approved, meaning it has passed a number of EU electrical safety directives.
The original USB Killer prototype, more clearly showing you the capacitors (the square components) and other parts of the system.
USB Killer version 1.0, with hand-soldered bits.</p>
<p>The USB Killer is shockingly simple in its operation. As soon as you plug it in, a DC-to-DC converter starts drawing power from the host system and storing electricity in its bank of capacitors (the square-shaped components). When the capacitors reach a potential of -220V, the device dumps all of that electricity into the USB data lines, most likely frying whatever is on the other end. If the host doesn’t just roll over and die, the USB stick does the charge-discharge process again and again until it sizzles.</p>
<p>Since the USB Killer has gone on sale, it has been used to fry laptops (including an old ThinkPad and a brand new MacBook Pro), an Xbox One, the new Google Pixel phone, and some cars (infotainment units, rather than whole cars… for now). Notably, some devices fare better than others, and there’s a range of possible outcomes—the USB Killer doesn’t just nuke everything completely.</p>
<p>In the video below you can see that a Galaxy Note 7 loses its USB port (so it can’t be charged), but otherwise remains functional; likewise, a new iPad Pro freaks out while the stick is plugged in, but seems to regain consciousness afterwards. Curiously, the Pixel is fine when a third-party USB-C converter is used, but using the official Google dongle results in a dead device.
One guy fries a ton of stuff with the USB Killer.</p>
<p>In another video it seems the iPhone 7 Plus suffers a similar fate to the Note 7: the Lightning port is fried, but the rest of the device is okay. You’ll also be glad to hear that the iPhone 4 and iPhone 3GS, connected via a 30-pin dongle, both seem to be immune to the USB Killer. All told, the company behind USB Killer says that 95 percent of devices are susceptible to a USB power surge attack.</p>
<p>Without taking a fried device apart it’s impossible to say how extensive the damage actually is. When you see the screen go black, and then not return after a reboot attempt, it’s likely that the surge travelled to the CPU or some other core component. If the victim device was a desktop PC, you might get away with replacing the motherboard—on a mobile or embedded device, diagnosing and fixing the issue is probably going to be more effort than it’s worth.</p>
<p>A better solution, of course, is protecting a system against the USB Killer in the first place, though that isn’t an easy task. Electrically, the most simple solution is an opto-isolator: a chip that uses an LED paired with a photodiode to physically isolate one electrical circuit from another. As devices move towards USB-C there’s another possible solution: USB authentication.</p>
<p>Neither of those solutions help protect the hundreds of millions—perhaps billions—of devices in the world with unprotected USB ports, though. Cars, airplanes, routers, machines that control industrial centrifuges… in those cases, the only real defence is physically capping ports or educating people to never insert unknown hardware.</p>

<p>The &quot;USB killer&quot; is dead: Apple drops FireWire support in macOS 26
The final nail in the coffin for FireWire
By Alfonso Maruccia June 20, 2025 at 12:13 PM 14 comments
The USB killer is dead: Apple drops FireWire support in macOS 26
Serving tech enthusiasts for over 25 years.
TechSpot means tech analysis and advice you can trust.</p>
<p>What just happened? FireWire was Apple&#x27;s ambitious attempt to establish a novel connectivity technology for its computer ecosystem back in the 90s. Now, Cupertino is unceremoniously removing the standard from its modern operating system capabilities.</p>
<p>Recently introduced macOS 26 &quot;Tahoe&quot; will bring a new naming scheme for Apple&#x27;s operating system ecosystem, novel features, and a highly questionable Vista-like UI redesign. The upcoming release will also mark the end of official support for outdated FireWire hardware. The so-called &quot;USB killer&quot; that was ultimately defeated by its own irrelevance is no more, at least according to developers testing the beta versions of the new OS.</p>
<p>macOS 26 beta is no longer compatible with first-generation iPods, or likely any other FireWire-based devices. The technology is being fully deprecated, reports confirm. In Tahoe, System Utilities and Finder no longer display FireWire storage devices, even when they are connected via Thunderbolt-to-FireWire adapters.</p>
<p>Officially known as IEEE 1394, the FireWire standard was developed by Apple in collaboration with other tech companies, including Sony and Panasonic. Apple first introduced the serial bus technology in some Macintosh models in 1999, as a replacement for the parallel SCSI bus. FireWire competed with USB at a time when it could achieve data transfer rates up to 30 times faster.</p>
<p>Despite offering more hardware features and better performance, FireWire was largely confined to Apple&#x27;s computing ecosystem. The technology was popular for digital video editing, audio equipment, and other professional tasks, but Apple eventually scrapped it as USB and other competing technologies such as Thunderbolt grew in popularity and capability.</p>
<p>Cupertino shipped its last iMac with a native FireWire port in 2011, but macOS continued supporting IEEE 1394 technology for several more years. Now, macOS 26 will kill support for good, forcing owners of older hardware peripherals and archivists to preserve legacy Macs or avoid updating the OS entirely.

<p>Apple routinely phases out older technology support in macOS, as the company isn&#x27;t particularly interested in preserving backward compatibility in the way Microsoft largely does with Windows. However, macOS 26 will be especially brutal in this regard, as it will also be the last version to support Intel-based Macs.</p>

<p>Wireless technology is used daily across the globe. A very common wireless technology is Bluetooth. The Bluetooth technology exists everywhere, from cars to mobile phones and even kitchen appliances. Recently, Bluetooth Low Energy has added support for another physical layer, LE 2M PHY. This physical layer is supposed to be faster and more energy efficient than its predecessor, LE 1M PHY, with a decrease in range. Because of this new physical layer, Bluetooth Low Energy can now compete with Bluetooth Classic during data transmission, in both speed and energy efficiency. This thesis aims to find the breaking point where Bluetooth Low Energy becomes less energy efficient than Bluetooth Classic, in relation to bit rate speed and total amount of bytes sent. Before experiments were conducted, multiple iterations of an artifact had to be done to end up with an artifact that provides valid and reliable data. The experiments were then conducted by changing the bit rate speed and sending different amounts of bytes. The results from the experiments show that Bluetooth Classic is practically both faster and more energy efficient with its fastest modulation than Bluetooth Low Energy is with LE 2M PHY enabled, even though this should not be the case theoretically. Bluetooth Classic is overall more energy efficient than Bluetooth Low Energy and thus the conclusion of this study is that no breaking points between the two technologies exist.

more energy efficient than its predecessor, LE 1M PHY, with a decrease in range.
Because of this new physical layer, Bluetooth Low Energy can now compete with
Bluetooth Classic during data transmission, in both speed and energy efficiency. This
thesis aims to find the breaking point where Bluetooth Low Energy becomes less energy
efficient than Bluetooth Classic, in relation to bit rate speed and total amount of bytes
sent. Before experiments were conducted, multiple iterations of an artifact had to be
done to end up with an artifact that provides valid and reliable data. The experiments
were then conducted by changing the bit rate speed and sending different amounts of
bytes. The results from the experiments show that Bluetooth Classic is practically both
faster and more energy efficient with its fastest modulation than Bluetooth Low Energy
is with LE 2M PHY enabled, even though this should not be the case theoretically.
Bluetooth Classic is overall more energy efficient than Bluetooth Low Energy and thus
the conclusion of this study is that no breaking points between the two technologies
exist.

<li>Introduction
1.1 Problem statement
Most people use wireless technology every day. Wireless technology could for example
be a tv remote control or wireless headphones. Though both being wireless, they use
diverse types of communication technology. Remote controls most commonly use
infrared communication (Maker.io Staff, 2022) while wireless headsets use Bluetooth
as a connector between the wireless object and the object to which it is connected to.
The focus in this thesis is Bluetooth technology, which is described more closely further
on.
Bluetooth is the leading technology in wireless data communication and the global
standard for simple and secure wireless connections (Bluetooth, 2022). Between
devices with Bluetooth technology, data can be transferred, for example music between
a phone and earbuds. Bluetooth can be found in most devices which supports pairing
with other devices.
Bluetooth´s aim was to offer a general-purpose connectivity solution (Marcel, 2018).
Over time, however, Bluetooth was primarily used for audio streaming. To return to the
original idea of offering the general purpose of Bluetooth technology, Bluetooth Low
Energy (BLE) was developed after the first Bluetooth Classic or as it is called Basic
Rate / Enhanced Data Rate (BR/EDR). Whereas BR/EDR offers a higher data transfer
speed than BLE, it is more suitable for audio streaming and data transfers. BLE, that
does not yet support audio streaming, supports data transfers, location services and
device networks (Bluetooth, 2022). Since BLE offers device positioning it can track
presence, distance, and direction to other devices. BLE also offers three types of
communication, namely point-to-point, broadcast, and mesh.
With the Bluetooth 5.0 release, BLE got a bit rate speed upgrade to support 2Mb/s,
which is only 1Mb/s slower compared to BR/EDR. This opened new possibilities for
BLE and was later announced that audio streaming would become available. This
makes it directly compete with the advantage of BR/EDR that were the only Bluetooth
variant to support it. For small devices with a low battery capacity this could be a good
addition to be able to save battery.
Earlier studies have been done about the efficiency of BLE, for example (Bulić, Kojek,
&amp; Biasizzo, 2019) concluded that the number of bytes sent was the variable that affected
the energy consumption. Their study was conducted by only measuring BLE efficiency
and did not compare it to BR/EDR.
According to (Bergelin &amp; Ericsson, 2019) there might be a breaking point where BLE
is less efficient than BR/EDR and thus, this study gives a better insight about the
efficiency of BLE. This might also make the decision whether to change from BR/EDR
to BLE for developers easier and better explain the difference for the customers. And
when looking up energy consumption for BLE and BR/EDR in data sheets there is only
shown the power consumption of one modulation for each technology and not
comparing the different modulations. Other studies have not researched in the area
about the breaking point and only about the efficiency of BLE or other similar
alternatives such as Zigbee (Siekkinen, Hiienkari, K. Nurminen, &amp; Nieminen, 2012).
7
Developers now a days has two different Bluetooth communication protocols to choose
from. Companies, such as Knowit (Knowit, 2022), who work with Bluetooth modules
for automotives would like to know if and where this breaking point could be. The
breaking point is the point where BLE becomes less efficient than BR/EDR when it
comes to the energy consumption.
1.2 Purpose and research questions
The purpose of this study is to find the breaking point where Bluetooth Classic becomes
more energy efficient than Bluetooth Low Energy when active. To achieve this, the data
of the energy consumption efficiency between Bluetooth Classic and Bluetooth Low
Energy in relation to bit rate speed and total amount of data sent must be measured and
compared. To measure this data a circuit must be created with enough reliability to
provide data with low deviation.
According to (Bergelin &amp; Ericsson, 2019), there could be a breaking point where
Bluetooth Classic and Bluetooth Low Energy cross in their energy consumption
efficiency. (Bergelin &amp; Ericsson, 2019) did not research this area and therefore leads to
this study’s first research question:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Where is the breaking point when comparing the energy consumption efficiency
between Bluetooth Classic and Bluetooth Low Energy, depending on bit rate
speed?
Related to the first research question, if a breaking point exists when measuring
efficiency on bit rate speed, then there must also be a breaking point when measuring
efficiency related to the total amount of data sent between Bluetooth devices. Thus, this
study’s second research question is as followed:</li>
<li>Where is the breaking point when comparing the energy consumption efficiency
between Bluetooth Classic and Bluetooth Low Energy, depending on total
amount of data sent?
To validate the two previous research questions, a circuit must be built. The circuit must
be precise and accurate to measure valid data with the least amount of disturbance from
external sources. This leads to this study’s third research question:</li>
<li>How can a circuit be built to accurately measure the required data to validate
and verify the two earlier research questions?
1.3 Scope and limitations
Since this study is a continuation on another study’s suggested research (Bergelin &amp;
Ericsson, 2019), the experiments must be conducted in a comparable way. The
experiments made by Bergelin, and Ericsson (2019) were conducted with the use of an
Android application supporting version 8.0 and newer.
This study does not use the previous study’s developed Generic Attribute Profile
(GATT), but instead use a Bluetooth stack provided by Knowit, called blueGO
8
(Knowit, 2022) The blueGO stack is built upon another Bluetooth stack made by
Opensynergy, called Blue SDK, which uses their own developed GATT. The blueGO
stack is only supported on a limited number of Bluetooth modules and thus the
experiments are limited to those specific modules.
When measuring with the artifact, the base current is excluded from the energy
consumption used by the Bluetooth module to get more accurate results. The previous
study also conducts experiments with external disturbance added, which this study does
not entail.
As this thesis work is conducted at Knowit a direction more towards automotive was
chosen. This reflects the hardware chosen which the experiments were conducted with
as the Jody-W263 is an automotive graded Bluetooth and Wi-Fi module. This is also
the reason why the BLE physical layer LE Coded PHY were not measured with in any
experiment. LE Coded PHY is a BLE modulation with a much better range for low
power wireless communication technology. As this physical layer is mostly seen in use
cases where greater range could be an advantage, the smart home sector is one example
of it. The greater range is then something that is not of use when only connecting for
example a mobile phone or earphones that will always stay within a short range inside
of an automotive.
1.4 Disposition
This study is divided into six chapters, including this chapter of introduction. The
chapter “Method and implementation” describes how this study’s process of data
collection and analysis is laid out. The next chapter, “Technical framework”, explains
the fundamental knowledge that is needed to conduct similar experiments. The chapter
after is the “Results” chapter, where the empirical data is displayed and presented. The
analysed results and methods used in this study are discussed in the chapter “Analysis”.
The next chapter is “Discussion” where the analysed data and the methods used are
discussed. The study is then concluded in the last chapter, “Conclusions and further
research”.

</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>Method and implementation
For this study, Design Science Research (DSR) (vom Brocke, Hevner, &amp; Maedche,</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2020">
<li>is the best methodology to use when building something that must be reliable and
provide accurate results. DSR develops artifacts in many iterations in to get products
that meets specified requirements. Hence, by using this methodology when creating a
circuit, a reliable, accurate and complete circuit has been made and therefore, valid, and
reliable data could be collected.
Figure 1: Example of a DSR iteration
To answer this study’s question 1 and 2 there will be a collection of empirical data from
the artifact created for this study. To then answer the questions a regression analysis
will be made to find the relations.
2.1 Data collection
The purpose of this study can only be fulfilled by recording data and thus, empirical
research is the method of choice to collect the data. The data was recorded in real-time
using the developed artifact. The data collected was the current going through the
Bluetooth modules chip. The data was collected by iterating through different bit rate
speeds and then within these speed settings iterate through various numbers of bytes
sent.
2.1.1 Design Science Research
This subchapter explains the different versions of the artifact that were developed by
using DSR.
2.1.1.1 Hardware Artifact
The artifact was iterated and built around the Jody-W164 Bluetooth module, using
different hardware and software to find the most reliable and accurate artifact. The first
iteration of the artifact was a simple circuit consisting of a power supply, an ampere
meter, the Jody-W164 Bluetooth module, a resistor, and a laptop. The laptop was
always connected to the Bluetooth module to initialize and setup the Bluetooth module.
10
Figure 2: Circuit Diagram of first DSR Iteration.
As seen in Figure 2, the Bluetooth module, resistor, power supply and ampere meter
are connected in series. The passive voltage probe from the oscilloscope was then
connected to the circuit across the resistor to read the voltage across said resistor. This
iteration provided readable data but having the ampere meter connected in series with
the rest of the circuit could add burden voltage, which can provide unreliable data if not
accounted for. A USB cable connected to the Bluetooth module was needed for data
communication.
Figure 3: Circuit Diagram of second DSR Iteration.
11
The next iteration, as displayed in Figure 3, is similar to the first iteration. The only
difference is the probe used. The second iteration of the circuit used a Current Probe,
which instead of measuring directly on the circuit, it measures the magnetic field around
the wire it is clamped on to. The second iteration of the artifact provided similar data,
but it was difficult to read and evaluate as the data the current probe provided had a lot
of noise.
Figure 4: Circuit Diagram of third DSR Iteration.
The third iteration of the artifact used the Power Profiler Kit 2 (PPK2) manufactured
by Nordic Semiconductor instead of a regular circuit. The PPK2 acts as a power source
to the Bluetooth module and is also able to measure the current being used by the
module. The PPK2 has software that is also made by Nordic Semiconductor, which
looks like a simplified oscilloscope. The software is needed to run the PPK2 properly
and it gives a variety measurement such as average current used, and total electric
charge used. The software also displays the electric signal as a graph, just like a regular
oscilloscope. The PPK2 can supply 500mA and up to 1A, for 1A supply a second USB
cable needs to be connected. For the configuration in Figure 4 with only one cable
connected to the Bluetooth module it was possible to both power it and read correct
measurements.
12
Figure 5: Circuit Diagram of fourth DSR Iteration
The fourth iteration of the artifact were made to update the Bluetooth modules that both
supported the Bluetooth 5.0 core specification. The Bluetooth modules also had to
support the optional feature of 2 Mb/s for BLE, the Bluetooth module chosen were a
Jody-W263 as seen in Figure 5 and the USB Bluetooth dongle changed to an Asus
USB-BT500. As the Bluetooth dongle does not connect to the hardware artifact it was
decided to not be part of the figure. Some changes had to be made with the hardware
artifact as the Jody-W263 could not be supplied through the PPK2. By cutting open the
USB cable that will supply the Jody-W263, the PPK2 could be connected in serial to
still be able to measure the Bluetooth module. The PPK2 still had to be connected with
another USB cable to get power itself and data communication with the computer. To
isolate current that is not from anything else other than the Bluetooth chip the jumper
for the LED´s were removed and only having Bluetooth activated.
13
2.1.1.2 Software Artifact
Figure 6: Flowchart diagram for software artifact.
The software side of the artifact were made up of Knowit´s Bluetooth stack BlueGO.
With their help and knowledge, a software artifact was made that made it possible to
send bytes ranging from 0x00 to 0xFF. Both technologies (BLE and BR/EDR) were
made to be as closely implemented as possible. From Figure 6 a demonstration of how
the artifact work is shown. One thing to mention is that with BLE the last packet sent
were not the correct data but sent an uncontrolled data packet. After discussions and
with the time available for this thesis project it was not investigated further to try and
fix this since there should not be any difference for the collected data. The correct
amount of data was sent, and all other packets had the correct data sent. This problem
was not met with BR/EDR. The software artifact was only implemented on the
transmitting Bluetooth module since the measured data was taken from the receiving
Bluetooth module it was not needed.
2.1.2 Experiments
Experiments to evaluate the artifacts were conducted with a Ublox Jody-W164 module
that supports Bluetooth 4.6 and a USB Bluetooth module with support of Bluetooth 4.0.
This was done due to the simple reason that it was the one available at the time and
similar enough. For the artifact evaluating it was decided to only use Bluetooth Classic
for the purpose of not having to reinitialize the Bluetooth modules and set everything
up again. For the testing of the artifacts three different amounts of bytes were used, 50k,
500k and 1M bytes. The reason for only using three diffirent numbers of bytes were
14
only because of the simplicity of testing the different artifacts. Later when doing the
experiments with the final iteration it was decided not to use 1M bytes but instead use
lower amounts of bytes between 50k and 500k. The reason why 1M were not used in
the final experiments were because of the extreme amount of bytes and such amounts
rarely appears in real life applications. This gave a better insight into the gap between
50k and 500k and a fourth and fifth test were added. For the final experiments it was
decided to use 50k, 100k, 250k, 350k and 500k. The Ublox Jody-W164 functioned as
the receiver while the USB Bluetooth module functioned as a transmitter.

The data collected for Table 1 can be seen under chapter Appendix from figure 24 to</li>
</ol>
<ol start="32">
<li>The data collection was also collected multiple times to ensure that the collected
data was reliable. Each amount of bytes sent were tested three times and then taken an
average of. This is done with the version 1 to 3 of the artifact, which is shown in the
table.
2.2 Data analysis
The data analysis for this study was done by conducting experiments and further
observe the collected data. A correlation between the energy consumption and the bit
rate speed of both Bluetooth technologies may be found by observing the collected data.
And to further investigate if there is a relation between the number of bytes that get sent
and its energy consumption. This data is then compared to other studies.
2.3 Validity and reliability
To increase the validity and reliability of an academic thesis, it is important to measure
relevant data and make sure that the tests and experiments can be replicated correctly.
To increase the trustworthiness of this academic thesis, the data for each relevant
parameter will be measured multiple times to ensure low deviation in the data.
To ensure validity the artifact created for the study are going through iterations of
improvements to ensure that correct and relevant data is measured. This is done through
the method DSR described earlier with aid from Knowit.
15
To increase the reliability of the study everything is being described thoroughly to make
sure the experiments can be remade. All the relevant flowcharts about the artifact and
all its iterations are available from the study and easy to replicate. The components are
mentioned from the study, and therefore the artifact will be able to be replicated with
the same hardware. The change of hardware chosen is described and what advantage it
gave to the study. The blueGO stack is licensed and therefore not available for the
public to use unless you have a license for it. There should not be any difference when
recreating the data collection with an open-source Bluetooth stack. As blueGO is used
across many different industries, for example automotives and medical/health devices
it should cover more or just as much as what other open-source Bluetooth stacks could
have.
2.4 Considerations
A consideration to take is that no experiments with artificially created disturbance were
conducted in this study. The study tried to minimize the external disturbances as much
as possible by measuring both Bluetooth types in the same environments with similar
conditions. The experiments were also conducted multiple times to remove the risk of
corrupted data and to determine whether the data can be reproduced. It is not possible
to eliminate all the external disturbances that could have possibly changed the outcome
of the data.
16</li>
<li>Technical framework
This chapter describes the fundamental knowledge that is needed to understand and
follow the experiments for this study and the knowledge needed to conduct similar
experiments.
3.1 Bluetooth
Bluetooth is a wireless communication technology that uses short-range radio
transmissions. The technology is used to transfer data between fixed and mobile
devices. The data is transferred using Ultra High Frequency radio waves over the
unlicensed Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM) frequency band that can range
from 2.4 to 2.48 GHz. Bluetooth can be split into two technologies, BR/EDR and BLE.
Bergelin and Ericsson (2019) mentions that there are two stacks which are mutually
used in both technologies, they both use a host and a controller stack. The stacks are
not equally built because they involve different protocols to offer different solutions.
Figure 7: Bluetooth stacks (Tosi, Taffoni, Santacatterina, Sannino, &amp; Formica, 2017)
There are three different configurations to be made, see Figure 7. The three stacks are
one for BLE, BR/EDR and one for dual mode that supports both technologies. The
stacks consist of three parts, host, host controller interface (HCI), and controller. The
third option of having a Bluetooth stack that supports both technologies is a
combination of all components from respective Bluetooth stacks.
3.1.1 Host
To understand the different parts of the host in a bluetooth stack the parts for BR/EDR
is explained first and BLE after.
BR/EDR:
17</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>SDP:
The first component Service Discovery Protocol (SDP) is used by a client device to find
the services that it can use with the server device. The SDP server maintains a database
with services that an application can discover to see what is available and to determine
the characteristics of the available services.</li>
<li>RFCOMM:
The Radio Frequency Communication (RFCOMM) protocol is an emulation of RS-232
serial port communication between devices wirelessly.</li>
<li>L2CAP:
The Logical Link and Control Adaptation Protocol (L2CAP) provides a connection-
oriented and connectionless data service to the upper layer protocols with protocol
multiplexing capability and segmentation and reassembly operations. It permits higher
level protocols and applications to transmit and receive upper layer data packets with a
size of up to 64 kilobytes in length. L2CAP also permits per-channel flow control and
retransmission. The L2CAP layer also provides logical channels, named L2CAP
channels, which are multiplexed over at least one or more logical links.
BLE:</li>
<li>GAP:
The Generic Access Profile (GAP) has three main purposes:
To introduce definitions, recommendations and requirements related to modes and
access procedures that will be used by transport and application profiles.
To describe how devices should behave in standby and in connecting states to prevent
situations where links and channels cannot be established between Bluetooth devices
or prevent multi-profile operations.
To express requirements for user interface aspects, mainly towards coding schemes and
names for procedures and parameters.</li>
<li>GATT:
The GATT defines the service framework by using the Attribute protocol (ATT). It
defines all procedures and formats of services. The procedures defined are for example
the discovering, writing, reading, notifying, and indicating characteristics.
18</li>
<li>ATT:
ATT allows the device referred to as the server to expose attributes and the associated
values to the client. The attributes exposed by the server can be discovered, read, and
written by the client and the server can respond, indicate, and notify to the client.</li>
<li>SMP:
The Security Manager Protocol (SMP) is a protocol for the generating of encryption
keys and identity keys for peer-to-peer connections. This block also handles the storing
of encryption keys and identity keys and are responsible for creating random addresses
to know device identities. It will also provide the controller with stored keys during the
encryption or pairing procedures.</li>
<li>L2CAP
The LE stack also consists of L2CAP just as BR/EDR has in its stack too.
3.1.2 Controller
To understand the different parts of the controller in a bluetooth stack the parts for
BR/EDR is explained first and BLE after.
BR/EDR:</li>
<li>LM:
Link Manager (LM) is used to control and negotiate operations of Bluetooth
connections between two devices. This includes the set-up and control of logical
transports, logical links, and physical links. The LM communicates between two
devices Link Managers. All LM messages should only use physical links, associated
logical links and logical transports between the sending device and the receiving device.</li>
<li>BR/EDR PHY:
BR/EDR radio (physical layer) operates in the 2.4 GHz unlicensed ISM frequency band.
To avoid interference and fading it uses a frequency hopper. The frequency hopper is
called Adaptive Frequency Hopping (AFH) and is something that both Bluetooth
technologies uses. AFH works such as the Bluetooth channels gets divided into two
categories, used and unused. The used channels are a part of the hopping sequence and
the unused will be replacing the used in a hopping sequence in a pseudo-random order.
AFH allows the Bluetooth device to use all its available channels, so for BR/EDR it can
use all the 79 channels available but not less than 20. BR/EDR channels range between
2.400 GHz to 2.4835 GHz and all channels are spaced by 1 MHz. The formula to find
all BR/EDR operating frequency bands:
𝑓 = 2402 + 𝑘 𝑀𝐻𝑧, 𝑘 = 0, … ,78
19
There are two modes to define the radio, the non-optional mode called Basic Rate (BR)
which uses a shaped, binary FM modulation. The second mode which is the optional is
called Enhanced Data Rate (EDR). This mode uses PSK modulation and has two
variants: π/4-DQPSK and 8DPSK. The symbol rate for BR/EDR is 1 megasymbol per
second. The bitrate speed for BR mode is:</li>
<li>1 Mb/s
And the bitrate speed for the optional mode EDR active:</li>
<li>2 Mb/s</li>
<li>3 Mb/s
The different types of modulations have different package formats. From Figure 8 and
Figure 9 the difference between a BR packet and EDR packet is shown.
Figure 8: BR packet format
The different length of the contents of a BR packet: Access code: 68 or 72 bits. Header:
54 bits. Payload: 0 to 2790 bits.
Figure 9: EDR packet format
The different length of the contents of a EDR packet: Access code: 68 or 72 bits.
Header: 54 bits. Guard: is a defined time period between 4.75 to 5.25 μs. Sync: 20 to
30 bits. EDR payload: 0 to 2790 bits. Trailer: 4 to 6 bits.
BR/EDR as mentioned in Introduction only supports one type of communication
Topology. BR/EDR supports Point-to-Point communication and are therefore only able
to communicate with one device at a time.
BLE:</li>
<li>LL:
Link Layer (LL) consists of multiple states which it operates in:
20
Figure 10: State diagram of LL state machine (Bluetooth SIG, Inc., 2016)
According to Bluetooth SIG, Inc. (2016) the states are defined as followed:
Standby state, in this state the Bluetooth device does not transmit or receive any packets
and can be entered from any state. From Figure 10 this state can be entered from any
state.
Advertising state, in this state the device will be transmitting advertising physical
channel packets and is able to listen to and responding to responses triggered by
advertising physical channel packets. From Figure 10 this state can only be entered
from standby state.
Scanning state, in this state the device will be listening for advertising physical channel
packets from devices who are advertising. From Figure 10 this state can be entered
from standby state.
Initiating state, in this state the device is only listening to advertising physical channel
packets from a specific device and respond to these packets to initiate a connection with
that device. From Figure 10 this state can be entered from standby state.
Connection state, in this state the device has a connection to another device. From
Figure 10 this state can be entered from Advertising state or Initiating state.</li>
<li>LE PHY:
Just like BR/EDR, BLE also operates in the 2.4 GHz unlicensed ISM frequency band.
BLE also uses the frequency-hopping spread spectrum called AFH to avoid interference
and fading. BLE has a range between 2.400 GHz to 2.483.5 and 40 channels with a
spacing of 2 MHz. The formula to find all BLE operating frequency bands:
𝑓 = 2402 + 2𝑘 𝑀ℎ𝑧, 𝑘 = 0, … , 39
21
BLE has two modulations defined, the first one is the mandatory LE 1M PHY with a
symbol rate of 1 Msym/s. The second optional modulation mode is LE 2M PHY with
a symbol rate of 2 Msym/s. The bitrate speed of LE 1M PHY is:</li>
<li>LE 1M PHY, uncoded data, 1 Mb/s</li>
<li>LE Coded PHY S=2, 500 kb/s</li>
<li>LE Coded PHY S=8, 125 kb/s
And the bitrate speed of LE 2M PHY is:</li>
<li>LE 2M, uncoded data, 2 Mb/s
A connection between BLE two devices differs from BR/EDR communication. BLE
have something called Connection Interval. A connection interval is a predefined time
to which the host should send data packets with the client until the next packet should
be sent. The time which the host exchange data packets with the client is called a
Connection Event. When the packets are exchanged and there still is time left of the
Connection Interval, the radio goes idle. Figure 11 shows what a Connection Interval
looks like.

The different types of modulations have different package formats. From Figure 12
and Figure 13 the difference between an uncoded and coded packet are shown.

As mentioned before in the Introduction, BLE supports different types of connections.
BLE supports different types of communication topologies, it supports Point-to-Point,
Broadcast and Mesh (Bluetooth, 2022). Broadcasting makes the BLE device able to
send packages out to any scanning or receiving device that is in the range of the device.
This is the fastest way to send out packets to multiple peers at a time. GAP defines two
roles in broadcasting, a broadcaster and observer. The observer continuously scans at
periodic intervals to see if there are any packets to receive from the broadcaster. The
broadcaster periodically sends out the packets to any device that can receive them. Mesh
is another way for BLE to communicate with. In this communication the device acts as
both host and client simultaneously. Mesh is an extensive network of multiple devices
without any connection but stays within the same network to communicate with each
other. And Point-to-Point connection is where connections are established one-to-one
(Bluetooth, 2022).
3.1.3 Host Controller Interface
The Host Controller Interface manages the connection between the host and the
controller of every Bluetooth device, it acts as an agent. The HCI provides a uniform
command method for the Host to access Controller capabilities and to control
connections to other Controllers. The HCI stores all its commands sent and received
and this data can be parsed by doing a so-called “HCI dump”.
3.1.4 Bluetooth Serial Port Profile
Bluetooth Serial Port Profile (SPP) is a GAP protocol that is pre-defined within
BR/EDR. SPP is a profile that is made to emulate physical serial ports such as RS232
with a virtual serial port through Bluetooth (Bluetooth, 2012).
23
Figure 14: Layers of SPP within GAP (Bluetooth, 2012)
The SPP protocol has several sub-protocols that depend on it as shown in Figure 14.
Figure 15: Model of SPP (Bluetooth, 2012)
The RFCOMM layer within the model displayed by Figure 15 is the layer enabling the
wireless communication by emulating a serial port. The point of this emulation is to
enable transmitting and receiving data through wireless communication. The amount of
data transmitted can vary between a couple of bytes up to multiple large files.
3.2 Electrical concepts
To accurately measure the current going through the Bluetooth module, several unique
factors must be considered. The biggest factors are explained in this sub-chapter and
are as followed: Small Voltages, Burden Voltage, Shunt Resistors, and Brownout.
24
3.2.1 Small voltages
To measure electrical current or voltage, a Digital Multimeter (DMM) is very
commonly used as they are cheap and easy to set up and measure with. DMMs
commonly have resolutions of one millivolt, which means that the DMM can only
measure changes at millivolt level. Thus, when measuring voltages lower than one
millivolt, a DMM is not a viable tool to measure the voltage.
When measuring small voltages, great care needs to be taken, due to low resistances
and thus too high current source can damage the electrical device. Other factors such as
various noise sources or thermoelectric effects can cause errors or offsets when
measuring the voltage (Daire, 2005). Daire (2005) mentions that thermoelectric effects
are often the dominant source to voltage offsets when measuring the electrical device
and suggests using a “three-point current reversal technique” to minimize the thermally
induced voltage.
3.2.2 Burden voltage
Burden voltage is the loss of voltage when measuring current through a measuring
device. This voltage drop can affect the circuit and thus show incorrect measurement
data. The circuit must be well thought out to minimize the amount of burden voltage
that may occur while measuring the Bluetooth module.
The effect of Burden Voltage can be calculated using Ohm’s law:
𝐼 = 𝑉
𝑅
Figure 16: Circuit examples (NI, 2018)
In Figure 16, circuit (a) has a 1.5-volt source with a 5 ohm’s load. Circuit (b) is similar
but with a 0.5-volt Burden Voltage due to the added DMM. By using the example
circuits, the effects of Burden Voltage can be calculated as such:
a) 1.5𝑉
5Ω = 0.3𝐴
b) 1.5𝑉−0.5𝑉
5Ω = 0.2𝐴
These calculations prove how much a DMM can influence the current going through a
circuit and how this can effectively corrupt the data if not measured properly.
3.2.3 Shunt resistors
According to EEPower (u.d.), a shunt resistor is defined as followed: “A shunt resistor
is used to measure electric current, alternating or direct. This is done by measuring the
25
voltage drop across the resistor.” A shunt resistor is commonly used when the electric
current going through a circuit is too high for the ampere meter or DMM. By adding a
shunt resistor to the circuit, the current is divided between the ammeter and shunt
resistor and thus larger currents can be measured (EEPower, n.d.).
3.2.4 Brownout
Brownout is a term within electronics that is defined as: “an intentional or unintentional
drop in voltage in an electrical power supply system.” This effect can last for minutes
up to multiple hours and could potentially damage multiple electrical devices (CD &amp;
Power, n.d.). Different to a Blackout, where the electrical power supply system will
shut down, current will still flow within the system during a brownout which can
possibly cause damage if the brownout occurs spontaneously (Direct Energy, n.d.).
After a brownout has occurred, a power surge is bound to happen, which is the biggest
factor to malfunctioning electronic devices.
3.3 Why Bluetooth Low Energy is more energy efficient
As BLE´s name suggest it is a more energy sufficient technology compared to BR/EDR.
But how does BLE manage to do it? The main difference between them is that BLE can
have the radio switched on for a short period of time (Donovan, 2011). When data is to
be sent connections can be established quickly and will be released as soon as the data
has been sent which will be minimizing the power consumption. BLE can scan for other
devices, connect, transmit data, confirm valid reception, and then terminate the link in
a period as little as 3ms. For BR/EDR this will typically require a period of over
hundreds of milliseconds. As BLE only uses three advertising channels the scanning
for other devices will be done much quicker than BR/EDR that uses 32 channels. This
results in a scan period of only 0.6 to 1.2ms rather than BR/EDR that takes around
22.5ms, this is also one way that BLE can consume less power. BLE also have the
advantage of using shorter packets, this can be seen in Figure 12 and Figure 13 for
BLE, Figure 8 and Figure 9 for BR/EDR with the amount of bits sent described. The
last thing that helps BLE with its efficiency is by using Gaussian frequency shift keying
(GFSK). Both BLE and BR/EDR uses GFSK, but the difference is that BR/EDR uses
a modulation index 0.35. Meanwhile the modulation for BLE is set somewhere between
0.45 to 0.55 which is closer to the level for Gaussian minimum shift keying. This
increase of modulation results in lower power consumed but is more prone to inter-
symbol interference.

This chapter presents and analyses the data that were collected during the conducted
experiments.
4.1 Empirical data
The following tables present the collected data from the conducted experiments. The
columns are divided into the total amount of data sent and the rows describe the time it
took to send the data, and the average electrical current used during that period. The
tables also have a third row, which subtracts the average electrical current used during
the module’s idle period from the average current used during the data sending. The
average idle for BR/EDR was 35.15 mA, and 33.67 mA for BLE in a connected state
and not sending any data. When measuring the current idle the Bluetooth module were
set as the host and in connected state with an interval of three seconds. The exact same
steps were taken for both Bluetooth technologies.
The three next tables are of collected data using Bluetooth Classic with its three
different speeds, 1 Mb/s, 2Mb/s, and 3Mb/s.

<li>Analysis
5.1 Estimated throughput versus measured throughput
With the Bluetooth 5.0 release, BLE got a new mode which was advertised as being
able to reach up to 2 Mb/s. This speed is only hypothetical and not possible to reach
practically. The estimated throughput for BLE according to the Bluetooth SIG’s
mathematical formula is around 1.4 Mb/s when using the LE 2M PHY activated (Ren,
2017). The estimated throughput for BR/EDR is 2.1 Mb/s when using the packet type
3-DH5 (Donovan, 2011).
The result from this study shows that BR/EDR has a faster throughput than BLE when
using its 3 Mb/s modulation. The experiments showed that when using BR/EDR’s 2
Mb/s, the practical throughput were on average 0.786 Mb/s. And while using its 3 Mb/s
modulation, the throughput were around 1.047 Mb/s. Meanwhile, when using BLE’s
1M PHY, the average throughput were around 0.522 Mb/s and 0.938 Mb/s when using
2M PHY. The bit rate speed for the BR/EDR 1Mb/s mode were at an average of 0.104
Mb/s. Using these results, it shows that on average, the BR/EDR throughput speeds are
faster than the BLE throughput speeds.

The energy consumption efficiency is calculated by multiplying the average measured
electrical current during the period the Bluetooth module is receiving data, times the
number of seconds that period lasted. This will give the total coulomb units used during
that period.

5.2 Analysis of research questions
The purpose of analysing the collected data is to answer the study’s research questions.
To analyse the data according to the research questions, experimentation and
observation and also comparison to other studies and datasheets must be made.

<li>Where is the breaking point when comparing the energy consumption efficiency
between Bluetooth Classic and Bluetooth Low Energy, depending on bit rate
speed?

5.2.1.1 BLE
Figure 17: BLE Total mC used
When comparing the different bit rate speeds of BLE looking at Figure 17 a trend can
be seen where the LE 2M PHY modulation for BLE tends to show a lower consumed
amount of coulomb when receiving data. Furthermore, when looking at Table 5 and
Table 6 the real difference is that LE 2M PHY has a lower average of mA drawn under
receiving compared to LE 1M PHY. The different modulation makes a difference then
by making the faster bit rate speed having a lower average of power consumed and on
top of that a shorter period receiving data transmission.
5.2.1.2 BR/EDR
Figure 18: BR/EDR Total mC used
When comparing the different bit rate speeds of BR/EDR looking at Figure 18 a trend
can also be seen where the least coulomb used tends to be the modulation with the
highest speed. Furthermore looking at Table 2, Table 3 and Table 4 a trend can be seen

where the modulations who support higher speeds will actually draw more average
effective power. The speed will therefore be the factor that in this case makes the
difference as it does have a shorter period of time that the data has to be sent compared
the slower modulations.
5.2.1.3 Compared
When comparing the two Bluetooth technologies no breaking point can be found. For
the experiments conducted BLE tends to show a much higher average under receiving
data transmission. The modulation for BR/EDR with 1 Mb/s is the only BR/EDR that
has a higher power consumed, but when comparing its average effective mA used it has
the lowest of all the modulations.

Figure 20: BLE LE 2M PHY mC used per byte
When comparing the mC used per byte between the LE 1M PHY from Figure 19 and
LE 2M PHY from Figure 20 for BLE no real pattern could be found. For BLE LE 1M
PHY the collected data seems to be very varied with no real pattern. For BLE LE 2M
PHY the collected data shows a higher mC used for 50k bytes sent. When sending more
data than 50k bytes a much more stable and lower mC used per byte. BLE LE 1M PHY
had an average of 0.10674 μC used per byte and LE 2M PHY had 0.05529 μC.

When looking at the mC used per byte for BR/EDR 1 Mb/s from Figure 21, BR/EDR
2 Mb/s from Figure 22 and BR/EDR 3 Mb/s from Figure 23 a pattern can be seen. The
average for 50k bytes will always be one of if not the highest. When bytes sent increase
the mC used per byte sent will also start to increase, this goes for all the different
modulations. BR/EDR 1 Mb/s had an average of 0.30486 μC used per byte, 2 Mb/s had
0.04364 μC and 3 Mb/s had an average of 0.037249 μC.
5.2.2.3 Compared
When comparing the mC used per byte between BR/EDR and BLE, the first noticeable
difference is how BLE has no real pattern unlike BR/EDR, which clearly shows that
when increasing the total amount of bytes sent, the mC per bytes sent also increases.
Whereas the graphs for BLE look more random. BLE has a higher average energy

energy efficient than BLE and thus no breaking point can be found.
5.2.3 Research question 3</li>
<li>How can a circuit be built to accurately measure the required data to validate
and verify the two earlier research questions?
By utilizing the DSR method and going through multiple stages of an artifact,
developing, and improving the artifact in many iterations, the data should become more
accurate. Looking at the first artifact, displayed by Figure 2, it was a very simple circuit
with an oscilloscope connected to it to measure the electrical current passing through.
As shown in Figure 24, the data measured had a lot of noise and may be affected by
burden voltage. Thus, the artifact needed improvements. The next artifact, described in
Figure 3, was very similar to the first one, using a current probe instead of a regular
voltage probe. As seen in Figure 29, the results of this artifact were a lot of added noise
to the data and the problem with burden voltage still exists. Figure 4 describes the third
iteration of the artifact, where instead of a circuit, the PPK2 is used to power the
Bluetooth module and read the electrical current used by it. The PPK2 were chosen
because of its ability to read measurements all the way down to 200nA and up to 1A
(Nordic semiconductor, u.d.). The software used for the PPK2 is shown in Figure 30,
and the data is presented like a simulated oscilloscope. The data is easier to read than
previous iterations and the risk of burden voltage is eliminated. In the fourth iteration,
the Bluetooth module, Jody-W164, was replaced with the Jody-W263 module, to
support the Bluetooth 5.0 technology and gain access to the newest BLE LE 2M PHY.
The set-up, as shown in Figure 5, was also different from the previous iteration, as the
computer had to power the Bluetooth module and the PPK2 had to be serially connected
with the USB-cable to read the data.

Looking at the empirical data collected, and the analysis done, it is possible to see the
difference in energy consumption between the technologies. Even though the expected
bit rate speeds for BR/EDR were not accomplished, the measured results of BR/EDR
were still better than the measured results of BLE. The results of BLE shows that BLE
is in average much less energy efficient than BR/EDR. The average idle electrical
consumption with BLE is 33.67mA compared to 35.14mA with BR/EDR. Even with
this difference, BR/EDR is more energy efficient when receiving data. By looking at
the graphs, it is possible to see that there is no breaking point between the two
technologies when comparing their energy consumption in correlation to the bit rate
speed. One reason that could have affected the result is the change of the connection
interval between sent packages. To speed up the throughput for BLE a connection
interval can be configured to send more packages within a smaller period. This means
that the module will almost constantly receive packets and have smaller intervals of
idle. And thus, if having a longer connection interval, the average energy consumption
will decrease, but the total energy consumed will increase over time.
Looking at the Bluetooth 5.0 core specifications the reason why BR/EDR 1 Mb/s
received data so slow depended on the packets type sent. The data packet defaulted to
DM1 which meant that the max rate would be 108.8 kb/s, even though we had DH5
activated that should give us a max rate of 433.9 kb/s. This means that if the right packet
would have been used it could of have had at least, in theory, one quarter of the time
used for receiving the same length of packets. This would of have meant an even better
energy efficient could of have been measured. The BR/EDR 2 Mb/s had used the 2-
DH5 packet with its speed of a max rate of 869.1 kb/s and had a respectable bit rate
speed achieved of 786.4 kb/s. The BR/EDR 3 Mb/s had also used the wrong data packet
type. BR/EDR 3 Mb/s had used the data packet type of 3-DH3 which meant a max rate
of 1177.6 kb/s. If the data packet type would have been the correct one the packet type
of 3-DH5 would of have been used. The speed for the 3-DH5 packet would have given
us a max rate of 1306 kb/s. As our experiments gave us a speed of 1047.4 kb/s, a speed
increase of at least 100kb/s could have been possible which would have given us a
slightly better effective energy consumption. This conclusion could be made after
looking at the user payload for each of the data packets and then comparing the speeds
which matches the core specifications with only a small percent of bit rate speed
difference.
Comparing the two BLE modulations a faster speed does make it more energy efficient.
When looking at the average mA drawn a clear advantage for LE 2M PHY is seen. With
36
LE 1M PHY having on average a 7.8% higher average mA drawn compared to LE 2M
PHY and having a slower bit rate speed by 400 kb/s it stands no chance. The LE 2M
PHY will therefore always have a shorter period when receiving the packets sent and
on top of that draw less on average mA.
When looking at the research question with the empirical data collected and the
analysis, there was no breaking point that could be found. Thus, because BR/EDR is
more energy efficient at sending data with lower mA drawn on average and having
higher speeds achieved. When comparing BR/EDR 1 Mb/s to both speeds of BLE it
also draws less mA on average but falls short because of its low speed and must receive
data for a much longer period.
6.1.2 Where is the breaking point when comparing the energy consumption
efficiency between Bluetooth Classic and Bluetooth Low Energy, depending on
total amount of data sent?
Further investigating the empirical data and analysis, it is possible to see a correlation
between the total amount of data sent and the energy consumption through how much
every byte consumed. When sending more data with BR/EDR a slow increase could be
seen while with BLE it did not show clear signs with LE 1M PHY to make any
difference. With BLE LE 2M PHY it showed a more stable but next to none changing
mC used per byte. By looking at the charts Figure 19 to Figure 23 there is a clear
difference between how much mC BLE uses per byte compared to BR/EDR. BLE uses
at an average more coulomb per byte than BR/EDR. BLE LE 1M PHY use 0.10674 μC
at an average, and LE 2M PHY use 0.05529 μC, as compared to BR/EDR 1Mb/s, 2Mb/s
and 3Mb/s use 0.30486 μC, 0.04364 μC and 0.03725 μC. By looking at this data it is
valid to say that no breaking points can be found because BLE were in general less
energy efficient than BR/EDR.
6.1.3 How can a circuit be built to accurately measure the required data to
validate and verify the two earlier research questions?
The requirement for the artifact was to have as little disturbance as possible to measure
valid data that would not be faulty in any way. By using the DSR method an artifact
that could be used to measure accurate data was created. The development of the artifact
was rather difficult as there were a lot of factors to think about to lower the risk of
disturbance and get accurate results. After four iterations we had the artifact needed to
measure and collect our data. The last iteration was using the Jody-W263 Bluetooth
module together with the PPK2 connected to a computer. This artifact had eliminated
the use of an actual circuit with measurements taken directly over the resistor, which
removes the risk of burden voltage and other risks such as temperature or noise that
would affect the data. Another study measuring the data transmission efficiency in BLE
(Bulić, Kojek, &amp; Biasizzo, 2019) used the first version of the PPK for measurement of
data. As the PPK they used has a resolution of 200 nA we believe this can further
increase our measurements validity as the PPK2 has a resolution of 100nA.

6.2 Method discussion
For this study we decided to use experimentation and observation with help of DSR as
our methods of choice to collect and analyse empirical data. We believe that this choice
of method was the most relevant one as the purpose of this study was to find the
breaking point where the energy consumption of BLE becomes worse than BR/EDR.
And to achieve this purpose, many iterations of both hardware and software had to be
tested and investigated. The methods we used gave us the relevant data needed to
answer the research questions. By using the experimentation and observation method
we could gather real life data and observe the data to see any correlations between
variables which gave us relevant data. The DSR method then provided us with reliable
data that we then could trust for the experiments and after multiple iterations of artifatcts
a reliable circuit was made.
By conducting experiments with multiple iterations, a higher validity and reliability has
been achieved. This is because more iterations with similar results will reduce the risk
of corrupt data and instead prove that the data gathered is valid and no external or
internal sources have faulted the data. Although we did not achieve the expected bit rate
speed when measuring BR/EDR, we still believe that we conducted the experiments
correctly since we used the correct modulations for BR/EDR and the results we got
would not have been very different if we reached expected throughput speeds. To make
sure that the right modulations were used the HCI dumps had to be checked for both
BLE and BR/EDR.

<li>Conclusions and further research
This chapter summarizes the study and presents implications and suggested further
research.
7.1 Conclusions
The purpose of this study was to research and investigate the potential existence of a
breaking point where BLE becomes less efficient than BR/EDR in terms of energy
consumption. The results from the conducted experiments show that BLE has overall
worse energy consumption efficiency than BR/EDR and that there is no breaking point
since BLE is shown to be worse.
7.1.1 Implications
The results from this study show the differences between BLE and BR/EDR and could
help the industry, more specifically car manufacturers, decide whether to use BR/EDR
or BLE as their Bluetooth technology in their cars.
7.2 Further research
Due to time limitations and other limitations mentioned in the chapter Scope and
limitations, further research exists.
Because we used a licensed Bluetooth stack that is not open for public use, similar
experiments but with an open-source stack would be interesting to analyse and verify
that there are no differences between a licensed Bluetooth stack and an open-source
stack.
The Jody-W263 we used for our experiments is a Bluetooth module focused on
automotive use and thus may have different results than when using a more common
Bluetooth module, such as a phone which is more heavily focused on small power
consumption. Thus, a relevant extension to this study would be to test multiple different
Bluetooth modules to see if there may be any differences.
